MapReduce is a programming model for large-scale distributed data processing.It is inspired by the map function and the reduce function of the functionalprogramming languages such as Lisp, Haskell, or Python. One of the mostimportant features of MapReduce is that it allows us to hide the low-levelimplementation such as message passing or synchronization from users andallows to split a problem into many partitions. This is a great way to maketrivial parallelization of data processing without any need forcommunication between the partitions.MapReduce became main stream because of Apache Hadoop, which is an opensource framework that was derived from Google's MapReduce paper.MapReduce allows us to process massive amounts of data in a distributedcluster. In fact, there are many implementations of the MapReduceprogramming model. Some of them are shown in the following list. It isimportant to say that MapReduce is not an algorithm; it is just a partof a high-performance infrastructure that provides a lightweightway to run a program in a lot of parallel machines. from: Practical Data Analysis, Hector Cuesta, 2013
